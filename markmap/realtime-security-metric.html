        # RealtimeSecurityMetric

        Use to keep track and observe the live traffic through the metrics. The further analytics graph use to provide the simple illustration for a quick action/response to perform.

        ## 1. High Request

        ### 1.1. Observation

        - Overall
          - ```sql
              -- 1. General Request
              SELECT
              count(*) as total_request
              FROM reqs
            ```

        ### 1.2. Just a normal day - Launch Caimpaign, Advertisement, Special day offer etc.

        ### 1.3. Under Attack

        - Req X Country - See if there any country that have more request than normal, then probably can consider to block the country
          - ```sql
                -- 1.3.1. Request from each country
                SELECT
                client_country,
                count(*) as total_request
                FROM reqs
                GROUP BY client_country
                ORDER BY total_request DESC
                LIMIT 10
            ```
          - ```sql
              -- 1.3.2. Request from each city
              SELECT
              client_city,
              count(*) as total_request
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY client_city
              ORDER BY total_request DESC
              LIMIT 10
            ```
        - Req X IP - See if there any IP that have more request than normal, find the IP to limit or block it
          - ```sql
              -- 1.3.3. Request from each IP
              SELECT
              client_ip,
              count(*) as total_request
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY client_ip
              ORDER BY total_request DESC
              LIMIT 10
            ```
        - Req X URI - See if there any URI that have more request than normal, find the URI to know which URI might have problem, and perform limit or blocking etc.
          - ```sql
              -- 1.3.4. Request from each URI
              SELECT
              uri,
              count(*) as total_request
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY uri
              ORDER BY total_request DESC
              LIMIT 10
            ```
        - Req X User Agent - See if there any User Agent that have more request than normal, could be some bot trying to attack, or some user agent that have problem
          - ```sql
              -- 1.3.5. Request from each User Agent
              SELECT
              user_agent,
              count(*) as total_request
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY user_agent
              ORDER BY total_request DESC
              LIMIT 10
            ```

        ### 1.4. DNS Problem (Being Poisoned)

        - Not sure how to check about this

        ## 2. High Bandwidth - Total, ResBody, ReqBody

        ### 2.1. Observation

        - Overall
          - ```sql
              -- 2. General Bandwidth
              SELECT
              sum(resp_size) as total_bandwidth,
              sum(resp_body_size) as body_bandwidth,
              sum(req_size) as req_bandwidth
              FROM reqs
            ```

        ### 2.2. Under Attack (Such as cc attack)

        - Bandwidth X IP - Check individual IP bandwidth usage, probably need to limit I download as well.
          - ```sql
                -- 2.2.1. Bandwidth from each IP
                SELECT
                client_ip,
                sum(resp_size) as total_bandwidth
                FROM reqs
                GROUP BY client_ip
                ORDER BY total_bandwidth DESC
                LIMIT 10
            ```
        - Bandwidth X Country - More toward check for do we need to deploy more server to the country or not.
          - ```sql
              -- 2.2.2. Bandwidth from each country
              SELECT
              client_country,
              sum(resp_size) as total_bandwidth
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY client_country
              ORDER BY total_bandwidth DESC
              LIMIT 10
            ```
        - Bandwidth X Cache Rate - Check if the cache rate is too low, then probably need to increase the cache rate.
          - ```sql
              -- 2.2.3. Bandwidth from each cache rate
              SELECT
              upstream_cache_status,
              sum(resp_size) as total_bandwidth
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY upstream_cache_status
              ORDER BY total_bandwidth DESC
              LIMIT 10
            ```
        - Bandwidth X URI - See which URI have more bandwidth, then check if the URI is under attack or not

        ### 2.3. It just a normal day

        - I cant imagine a normal day that have high bandwidth, but if there is, then probably need to check the bandwidth usage by IP, Country, Cache Rate, and URI.

        ## 3. High Latency

        ### 3.1. Observation

        - Overall
          - ```sql
              -- 3. General Latency
              SELECT
                avg(latency_ms) as avg_latency,
                max(latency_ms) as max_latency,
                min(latency_ms) as min_latency
                FROM reqs
                ;
            ```
          - 90/95 percentile is not doable

        ### 3.2. Under Attack

        - Latency high with much request, could be under attacking

        ### 3.3. Server slowdown

        - Latency High but request not much with bandwidth look ok, probably need to check the server performance
        - Upstream IO traffic time- Check if the upstream IO traffic is it too high, then probably need to check the upstream server

        - Latency X Country - Check if the latency just happened on some specific country
        - Latency X IP - See which client experience high latency
        - Latency X User Agent - See which device experience high latency
        - Latency X URI - Check which endpoint experience high latency

        ## 4. High Error

        ### 4.1. Observation

        - Overall
          - ```sql
              -- 4. General Error
              SELECT
              sum(is_status_4xx) + sum(is_status_5xx) as status_4xx5xx,
              sum(is_status_4xx) + sum(is_status_5xx) / count(*) as status_4xx5xx_rate,
              sum(is_status_3xx) as status_3xx,
              sum(is_status_4xx) as status_4xx,
              sum(is_status_5xx) as status_5xx
              FROM reqs
            ```
          - error rate is not countable, as it doesnt perform divide

        ### 4.2. 4XX & 5XX

        - Error X Req - Check if the increase in error is it normal due to the increate in request, probabily need determine with error as well
        - Error X SSL, TLS - Check if the error is it due to the old SSL, TLS version, if so just block the old version
          - ```sql
              -- 4.2.1. Error from each SSL, TLS version
              SELECT
                  http_ver,
                  tls_ver,
                  sum(is_status_4xx) + sum(is_status_5xx) as error_count,
                  count(*) as request_count
              FROM reqs
              GROUP BY http_ver, tls_ver
              ORDER BY request_count DESC
              LIMIT 20;
            ```
        - Error X IP - See which IP have more error, then see either to block or further investigation required
        - Error X Country - See which country have more error, we can ban the country if there is too much error or see is there any adjustment/fix to the country
        - Error X User Agent - See which User Agent (Could be browser, phone, etc) have more error, then check if the page need to be fix or need to block the user agent
        - RateError(429) X IP X URI - See which IP and URI have more rate error, then check if the IP and URI is under attack or not
          - ```sql
              -- 4.2.5. Rate Error from each IP and URI
              SELECT
              client_ip,
              uri,
              count(*) as error_count
              FROM reqs
              WHERE is_status_429 is true
              GROUP BY client_ip, uri
              ORDER BY error_count DESC
              LIMIT 20;
            ```
        - UnauthorizedCalls(401) X IP X URI - See which IP and URI have more unauthorized error, then check if the IP and URI is under attack or not
          - ```sql
              -- 4.2.6. Unauthorized Calls from each IP and URI
              SELECT
              client_ip,
              uri,
              count(*) as error_count
              FROM reqs
              WHERE is_status_401 is true
              GROUP BY client_ip, uri
              ORDER BY error_count DESC

              SELECT
              client_ip,
              uri,
              count(*) as error_count
              FROM reqs
              WHERE is_status_403 is true
              GROUP BY client_ip, uri
              ORDER BY error_count DESC
              LIMIT 20;
            ```

              sum(upstream_byte_received) as upstream_egress
              FROM reqs
            ```
        ### 6.2. Upstream Connect Timer

        - Average Upstream Connect Timer - Check if the average upstream connect timer is too high, then probably need to check the upstream server
          - ```sql
              -- 6.1.1. Average Upstream Connect Timer
              SELECT
